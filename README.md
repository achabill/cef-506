===================

A simple chat application with flask sockiet io

To run this application install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and then, run `python chat.py` and visit `http://localhost:5000` on one or more browser tabs.

If you prefer, you can also start the server using the Flask cli:

    $ FLASK_APP=chat.py flask run
